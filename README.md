# Game Hub
Written in React + TypeScript + Vite

Game Hub is a web app that helps you discover new and interesting video games. Search by platform, genre, and more to find your next favorite game. 

It uses the RAWG API key and showcases a front-end app with React and TypeScript using reusable function components, I manage component state, fetch and update data using React Query, and build forms with React Hook Forms (form validation uses Zod).
